- 👋 Hi, I’m Serge and working as a Microsoftee on Azure DevOps, Azure Monitor and System Center Operations Manager.
- 👀 I’m interested in getting to know everything about DevOps because I'm a firm believer of DevOps.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about DevOps and am focussing on getting Azure DevOps certified.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how we can use DevOps to improve monitoring (as broad and as detailed as it gets) from both a technical and a process perspective.
- 📫 You can reach me by e-mail on serge.zuidinga@microsoft.com
